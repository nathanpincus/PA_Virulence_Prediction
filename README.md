# PA Virulence Prediction
Scripts to perform machine learning analyses in “A Genome-based Model to Predict the Virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolates“

## Dependencies
Analyses were performed in Python v3.6.9 with the following modules:  
scikit-learn v0.21.2  
pandas v0.24.2  
numpy v1.16.4  
matplotlib v3.1.1  

## Input Data
Input data to run these analyses as performed in the manuscript is provided in the Data directory. The 10-mers feature set was compressed for size limitations and would need to be expanded before use.

## Assemblies
Hybrid assemblies for PABL012, PABL017, PAC1, and PAC6 used in this study are older versions than what has been deposited to NCBI. The versions used in this study are provided in the Assemblies directory.

## Running
Paths for the input data (and required functions) need to be specified in each script.

Some scripts (e.g. PASP_VirulencePrediction_BLSF_RF_AGEs_PermutationTesting.py) utilize machine learning models or input data (saved as .pkl files) generated by other scripts

Scripts were run on a 24-core node with 120 GB of RAM
