# PA Virulence Prediction
Scripts to perform machine learning analyses in “A Genome-based Model to Predict the Virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolates“

## Dependencies
Analyses were performed in Python v3.6.9 with the following modules:  
scikit-learn v0.21.2  
pandas v0.24.2  
numpy v1.16.4  
matplotlib v3.1.1  

## Input Data
Input data to run these analyses as performed in the manuscript is provided in the Data directory. The 10-mers feature set was compressed for size limitations and would need to be expanded before use.

## Assemblies
The version of the assemblies used in this study for all isolates are provided in the Assemblies directory.

## Running
Paths for the input data (and required functions) need to be specified in each script.

Some scripts (e.g. PASP_VirulencePrediction_BLSF_RF_AGEs_PermutationTesting.py) utilize machine learning models or input data (saved as .pkl files) generated by other scripts

Scripts were run on a 24-core node with 120 GB of RAM
